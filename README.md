# Topic-Modeling-Project
This Rep. displays the implementation of the topic modeling algorithms we used for the project "Topic modeling and analysis of presidential speech".
The project involves implementing a topic modeler like Latent Dirichlet Allocation or Hierarchical Dirichlet Process or Deep Boltzmann Machines based topic modeler and using that to analyze Presidential speech transcripts. Using this you can analyze the presidential speech transcripts and perform qualitative and quantitative analysis and present interesting insights about candidates.
