Hey guys

Here's a way to give the project a more interesting twist:
Step 1: Create the RBM and train it to identify a bunch of topics
Step 2: Run a bunch of speeches selected by decade (1950s speeches, 1960s speeches, ...) (or another length)
Step 3: Run a bunch of press articles on politics with the same timescales
Step 4: compare, and see if the media induces presidential topics, or the Commander in Chief induces press articles (or both, or when...)

So, for the data, I have access to NYTimes, and I'm sure we can access the BBC repositories as well.

The data they provide will need some pretreatment, I will start working on that next week! :)

Best,
Jonas
